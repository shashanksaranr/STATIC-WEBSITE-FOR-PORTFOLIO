#Description:
As part of the CodTech internship, I designed and developed a static website for a personal developer portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This portfolio website showcases my skills, projects, education, and contact information in a professional and visually appealing format. The main objective was to build a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface that highlights my capabilities as a web developer and serves as a digital resume for potential employers or clients.

#Tools and Technologies Used:
1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML was used as the backbone of the website. I structured the entire content into semantic elements to maintain clean and readable code. These tags helped create the layout for the landing page, about me section, skills, portfolio/projects, and contact form. HTML provided the essential structure that was styled and enhanced using CSS and JavaScript.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS was used extensively to design the user interface and ensure a consistent visual theme throughout the site. I implemented flexbox and grid layout systems to arrange elements responsively, ensuring that the website adapts well to various screen sizes including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Styling included custom fonts, color schemes, hover effects, animations, and transitions to make the user experience more engaging. I also used media queries for responsive design, allowing the website to adjust layout and font sizes based on screen width.

3. JavaScript
JavaScript was incorporated to add dynamic behavior to the static site. I used it to handle form validation on the contact page, implement scroll animations, and create a smooth navigation experience. Additionally, I added a toggle feature for dark and light themes, giving users the ability to customize their viewing experience. JavaScript enhanced the overall user interactivity without relying on backend technologies, staying within the scope of a static website.

#Key Features Implemented:
1. Landing Page with a professional introduction, name, role, and a call-to-action button to download the resume.
2. About Me Section with a brief biography, background, and a photo.
3. Skills Section displaying my technical proficiency in various programming languages, frameworks, and tools.
4. Projects/Portfolio Section where I presented my recent projects, each with a title, short description, technologies used, and links to GitHub.
5. Contact Form that captures the user's name, email, with JavaScript used for front-end validation.
6. Responsive Navigation Menu with smooth scrolling to sections.

#Design Philosophy:
The design followed modern web development practices emphasizing simplicity, accessibility, and responsiveness. I used a minimal color palette, consistent spacing, and readable fonts to maintain clarity. The layout was designed to guide the userâ€™s attention smoothly from top to bottom, presenting information in a logical and user-centric manner.
